          <h2>Definition</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>SRE:</strong> Responsible for maintaining the
            <strong>RELIABILITY</strong>, <strong>SCALABILITY</strong>, and
            <strong>PERFORMANCE</strong> of production systems. Combines
            software engineering with operational expertise to automate tasks,
            reduce manual work (toil), improve system
            <strong>OBSERVABILITY</strong>, and ensure high system
            <strong>AVAILABILITY</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>15-minute Speaking Plan</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Intro — 1 min</strong>: Brief definition (above) and your
              role transition into SRE.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>FSA / Prod incident response — 5 min</strong>: Expand on
              incident load (assigned thousands of tickets), outage notices,
              tiger teams, writing RCAs, communicating to stakeholders, and
              participating in post-incident reviews/murder boards. Give 1 short
              anecdote (30–45s) about a high-severity outage you helped resolve
              and what you automated afterward.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DevOps pipeline work — 3 min</strong>: Describe CI/CD,
              test automation, rollout strategies, and any tooling you helped
              maintain or improve. Mention how pipelines reduced deployment toil
              and increased reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Auth & integrations (eBOSS / Okta / 2FA / favicon) — 2
                min</strong
              >: Talk about identity integrations (Okta, 2FA), eBOSS
              adjustments, and small but important production fixes like
              favicon/branding that improve user experience and reduce support
              noise.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SVD script work — 1.5 min</strong>: Explain the scripts
              you wrote to automate data collection, health checks, or scheduled
              maintenance and how they cut manual effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>BitBucket / Java upgrades & bug fixes — 1.5 min</strong>:
              Mention upgrading Java, emulating user features for testing, and
              fixing bugs in source control workflow; emphasize safe rollout and
              testing strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confluence & documentation — 1 min</strong>: Highlight
              writing runbooks, playbooks, and post-incident summaries that made
              on-call onboarding and incident response faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wrap-up & Q/A — 0.5 min</strong>: Recap biggest impacts
              (automation, observability, uptime improvements) and invite
              questions.
            </li>
          </ol>
